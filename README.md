This project contains two parts: modeling part and streaming part:

For modeling part, I did some summarization and used pysparkâ€™s MLlib module to set up a pipeline for Elastic Net fit including PCA transformer. Then I used cross validation to select the best model and evaluate model performace via RMSE metric.

For streaming part, I used model transformer to obtain predictions from the incoming data. Then I created second pipeline that would take all the predictor columns from original data with transforamtion. After combining two dataframes, I wrote those out to the console. Finally, I can monitor the prediction on incoming data by randomly sampling three rows and output those to a .csv file in the folder.
